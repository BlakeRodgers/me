\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is for ATK301. My name is Blake Rodgers and I am 23 years old. I was born here in town and raised here until I graduated from high school. I originally moved to Texas for college and to continue my education but I ended up getting a summer internship at a company called Blizzard entertainment as a secretary. I personally love all of Blizzard\'92s games so this was almost like a dream come true, even though it was just a secretary. After 6 months I was offered a job instead of an internship, which I took, obviously. With my time at Blizzard I actually made it up to team leader of a group of game masters (which are the people you contact online who can help you with issues on the game). Even though I loved my job I decided to go back to school to finish my education so I could possibly go back to Blizzard in the future and continue my career. I ultimately decided to move back to Illinois where the rent is cheap and the winters are terrible.}
